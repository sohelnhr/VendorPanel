The Toy Robot Challenge is a coding exercise designed to simulate a toy robot moving on a 5x5 square tabletop. The primary objective is to develop an application that can read and execute commands such as "PLACE," "MOVE," "LEFT," "RIGHT," and "REPORT." These commands allow the robot to be placed on the table, moved in specific directions, rotated, and report its current position. The key challenge is ensuring that the robot does not fall off the table, regardless of the sequence of commands provided. This exercise tests problem-solving skills, understanding of basic programming concepts, and the ability to handle edge cases effectively. It's an interesting project because it blends logical programming with practical constraints, making it a great discussion point for understanding a candidate's approach to software development.
