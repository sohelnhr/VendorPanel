The Toy Robot Challenge involves creating a simulation where a toy robot moves on a 5x5 square tabletop. The key points of the challenge are as follows:

Commands and Movements:

PLACE X,Y,F: This command sets the robot on the table at coordinates X, Y facing North (N), South (S), East (E), or West (W).
MOVE: Moves the robot one unit forward in the direction it is currently facing.
LEFT and RIGHT: Rotates the robot 90 degrees to the left or right without moving from its spot.
REPORT: Outputs the current position and direction of the robot.
Rules:

The robot must not fall off the edge of the table during movement. Commands that would cause the robot to fall must be ignored.
Commands are ignored until a valid PLACE command has been executed.
The bottom left of the grid is considered the coordinate (0,0).
Inputs and Outputs:

Commands can be given through standard input or from a file.
For example, if the command sequence is "PLACE 0,0,NORTH", followed by "MOVE", and then "REPORT", the output should be "0,1,NORTH".
This challenge not only tests your programming skills but also your ability to handle edge cases and follow specifications precisely. It's often used to assess problem-solving skills, coding style, and familiarity with basic programming concepts such as control structures and data types.

Feel free to implement additional features like a graphical user interface or expanded command options if you wish to go beyond the basic requirements. This can be a great way to demonstrate your skills and creativity.
